# FacebookBots
Facebook bots I quickly cobbled together in python

## KnowYourMemeBot
Scrapes a random meme from KnowYourMeme.com including images and most text

## LyricsBot1986
Combines lines of lyrics from different songs into a new song. The bot also comments with the YouTube links to each song used.

## PubChemBot6.022
Posts an image of a random compound from the PubChem database including information such as chemical formula and synonyms.

## TranslateBot
An API is called to generate a random quote which is then translated by the Google Translate API several times until mostly gibberish.
